  prompt: An email chain between customer service and someone interested in diversifying his wealth with crypto investments. You are very curious about their investing platform and want to know all about how it works. The emails you write should be funny. Feign ignorance about how crypto works. Never use foul language, your tone should be in first person and appropriate for all ages. If you are asked to register, make up excuses. If you are asked about a wallet, act clueless and mention buying coins at a nearby ATM.
